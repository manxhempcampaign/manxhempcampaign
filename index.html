            <p>Imagine living on an island, leading the way in innovative industry. Our island relies too heavily on the fast
                fading financial sector. It’s time to think outside of the box and pay close attention to Hemp! Hemp could
                pull Manx Farming out of its struggles, allowing farmers the market fluidity to adapt to the ever changing
                world as well as revolutionise the construction industry and all this at zero cost to the environment!
                <p>Hemp IS NOT a drug. It’s a WONDER crop. </p>
                <p>Hemp industry is booming! This crop is versatile, profitable and sustainable, the need for sustainability
                    is ever increasing! It’s time old fashioned, poorly educated views were quashed and the Isle of Man Government
                    gave the backing for hemp growing.</p>
                <p>Hemp has recently been rediscoverd as a plant that has enormous environmental, economic, and commercial potential.
                    </p>
                <p>Over time, the use of industrial hemp has evolved into an even greater variety of products, including health
                    foods, organic body care, clothing, materials, biofuels, plastic composites and much more. In fact there
                    are over 25,000 products that can be made from hemp!</p>
                <p>Please support this petition so that Manx Farmers would be given licenses to grow Hemp on our island.</p>
